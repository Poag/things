# Before we get started
*Note: My environment consists of both Linux and Windows machines.*

You will need to know how to edit config files from the linux command line. I recommend using nano as thats what this tutorial will use. If you don't have nano installed you get get it by doing `apt-get install nano` or `yum install nano`.

For editing config files on Windows I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Its awesome, open source, and has a dark theme by default!
