> If you run Grafana behind a reverse proxy with SSL or straight up SSL you need to make sure URLs in iframe panels are HTTPS! Otherwise Chrome may not load them!

## Useful links

- [Discord Help Server](https://discord.gg/8y6sndR) - For these guides and the scripts in my repository.
>Some of the repos listed in the guides have their own discord servers. So if you need help with a particular service, go there first!
- [List of InfluxDB things](https://github.com/mark-rushakoff/awesome-influxdb) - Useful stuff for Influxdb
- [Tip](https://alexsguardian.net/donate) - If you want to tip me for my effort. Not expected but appreciated. (Allows me more time to work on this as the Wife won't be as mad... lol...)
